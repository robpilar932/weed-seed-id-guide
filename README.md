# Weed Seed Identification Guide

A collaborative open-source field guide for identifying seeds of common agricultural weeds.

## Purpose
This guide serves as an educational resource for students, a quick reference for agronomists, and a basis for future research on weed seed management. It focuses on the botany and seed biology of dryland, gardenland, and wetland weeds, with an emphasis on economically and environmentally acceptable weed management systems.

## Scope
The initial scope covers weeds commonly found in temperate agricultural systems, with plans to expand to other regions. Each entry includes:

- Scientific and common names
- Origin and distribution
- Habitat and habit
- Detailed seed morphology (size, color, surface texture, distinctive features)
- Seed dispersal unit and mechanism
- Distinguishing features from similar species
- Notes on reproductive biology and seed longevity

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from agronomists, botanists, students, and anyone interested in weed science.

### Adding a New Weed Species
1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/robpilar932/weed-seed-id-guide/issues) to see if the species has already been proposed.
2. If not, open a new issue using the "New Weed Species" template.
3. Once the issue is approved, fork the repository and create a new branch.
4. Add a Markdown file for the species in the `/species/` directory, following the naming convention `genus-species.md` (e.g., `portulaca-oleracea.md`).
5. Follow the profile template (see `PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md`).
6. Submit a pull request, referencing the issue number.

### Editing Existing Entries
Feel free to improve existing entries by submitting pull requests with corrections, additional details, or better images.

### Review Process
All contributions are reviewed by the maintainers for accuracy and completeness. Inline comments may be added to suggest improvements.
